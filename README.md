This project is a based on the prototype i made in design 1.
I decided to make some changes to the design. I found it better to have 2 columns (1 column on smaller mobile screens) on the product page instead of a carousel slider. to show that i did not make that choice based on me finding it difficult to make one, i included a recommended games section whith a carousel slider, on the product details page. I also made some improvements to the cart and product details.
